Hydra is at first fairly complicated, but once I got some level of grasp on it I was able to manipulate colors and textures. At first I aimed to just break the visual, I wanted to make an effect of my screen just melting. I got to it by accident. I feel that the language is super intuitive once you get the hang of it. I want to delve more into hydra's relationship with osc and music. I'd like to see hydra having a fuction that allows it to get manipulated by music or sound. I feel that hydra is geared toward visualization of osc and perlin noise to name a few. P5js on the other hand is able to create a vairety of programs that hydra can't possibly do.
